# Progress

## Current phase

**Week 1 - Substrate + trace bus complete.** 15 verification tests passing, 10 skipped (Week 2-7 placeholders). FHRR and HRR primitives, Codebook cleanup, and the trace bus all in place, all scaffold-free witnesses green.

## Next milestone

**Week 2**: five named modulators (`attention`, `reward`, `arousal`, `recency`, `gating`) wired to specific ops, with effect tests proving each scalar moves its target metric monotonically.

## Open questions

- HRR inverse fidelity at low N - test currently asserts sim > 0.5 at N>=1024; tighten after collecting empirical distribution.
- Trace bus overhead at micro-bench scale is dominated by Python call overhead; Week 4 batched/sampled tracing should bring it under 10% on representative workloads.
- Storage choice: DuckDB vs SQLite for trace persistence - currently DuckDB.
