# CLAUDE.md

Conventions for AI-assisted work in this repository.

## Project

`hd-instrument` is an observable hyperdimensional computing substrate. See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the full build plan and [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) for current status.

## Conventions

- Python 3.11+, PyTorch tensors with explicit dtypes (complex64 for FHRR, float32 for HRR).
- `N` (vector dimensionality) is a config constant, default 1024.
- All randomness uses a passed-in `torch.Generator` with a known seed.
- Type hints on all public functions. One-line docstrings with shape annotations.
- All vectors are `torch.Tensor`; never `numpy.ndarray` at API boundaries.

## Style

- Direct, terse code. No unnecessary abstraction.
- One-line docstrings, max. No multi-paragraph comment blocks.
- No emojis in code, comments, or output.
- No em dashes in code output.

## Verification discipline

- Every framework feature ships with at least one scaffold-free witness in `verification/`.
- Verification tests must pass with `tracing=False`.
- `python verification/run_certification.py` must pass on `main`.

## When implementing a new feature

1. Write the closed-form theory or oracle comparison in `verification/theory.py` or `reference/`.
2. Write the verification test in `verification/`.
3. Implement the feature in `hdlab/`.
4. Run `pytest verification/` and confirm green.
5. Update `PROGRESS.md`.
