## Cycle 175 — v155 BETA_M_INIT_OOM_INCONCLUSIVE (Sweep A) + Sweep B real KILL at M/N>=2 (N=8192)

**Time**: 2026-05-23 ~10:53 EDT
**Trigger**: `wave14_betA_M_init_threshold_v2` FULL verdict
BETA_M_INIT_OOM_INCONCLUSIVE (combined Sweep A + Sweep B).

### What landed

`exp_wave14_betA_M_init_threshold_v2` ran both sweeps:

- **Sweep A** (N=65536, M_init in {1024, 2048, 4096, 8192}, 5 seeds, 100 edits):
  ALL four M_init points returned `oom=True n_seeds=0 mean_kept=0.0`. The
  per-iteration `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` fix (v154 Option A
  recommendation) did NOT resolve the N=65536 OOM. 8GB VRAM remains
  insufficient at N=65536 for the M_init capacity sweep even at the
  smallest M_init=1024. Combined verdict surfaces this as
  BETA_M_INIT_OOM_INCONCLUSIVE per the new v2 verdict semantics.
- **Sweep B** (N=8192, M_init in {16384, 32768, 65536}, 5 seeds, 100 edits):
  ALL three M_init points returned `n_seeds=5 mean_kept=0.0 oom=False`.
  This IS a real substrate measurement, NOT an OOM artifact. Sub-verdict
  for Sweep B alone would be BETA_M_INIT_UNIFORM_KILL.

### Interpretation

**Sweep B's KILL is EXPECTED, not a substrate refutation.** The
M_init/N ratios are 2, 4, 8 (M/N in {2, 4, 8}) at N=8192. The
substrate's AGS-class capacity ceiling places the continual-edit
operating regime well below M/N=1; the cycle 172 v2 rescued operating
point was M_init=8192 N=65536 (M/N=0.125, EIGHT-fold below the failed
regime). Per [[feedback-dont-overextend-theorems]] Sweep B confirms the
capacity ceiling sits between M/N=0.125 (cycle 172 PASS) and M/N=2
(Sweep B KILL) at N=8192. It does NOT refute Bet A; it tightens the
characterized envelope.

**Subtlety vs cycle 92 M=16N smoke**: cycle 92 reported Bet A continual
editing scaled to M=16N at N=4096 with 100 edits smoke
(CONTINUAL_16N_KERDOCK_HOLDS). Sweep B at N=8192 M_init=65536 (which is
M=8N if framed against N=8192, NOT M=16N) returns KILL at FULL with 5
seeds 100 edits. The cycle 92 datapoint is at smaller N with the
`continual_NN_edits` experiment family; Sweep B uses the M_init
threshold experiment family which runs `ba.run_one_seed`. The two
families measure different protocols (continual edit budget vs M_init
threshold). Not directly comparable; no retraction of cycle 92.

**Sweep A's OOM remains unresolved.** Memory hygiene (empty_cache per
iteration) did not free enough VRAM. Per the experiment script, the
allocation peak is inside `ba.run_one_seed` (substrate state + W matrix
+ codebook + activation buffers) and exceeds 8GB at N=65536 with
M_init=1024. Three options for what to do next, ranked by leverage / cost.

### Why NOT a closure row

Per PROT-004/006: a closure (bare or PROVISIONAL ❌) requires 5 rescue
sketches + a Research rehab request. This event does NOT meet the
closure threshold for three reasons:

1. **Bet A axis HOLDS at the rescued operating point**. M_init=8192
   N=65536 (cycle 172 v2 5-seed PASS) is unchanged. No row demotes from
   ✅.
2. **Sweep A is INCONCLUSIVE (OOM), not a measurement**. Same as v154.
3. **Sweep B's KILL is EXPECTED** (M/N>=2 well above AGS ceiling).
   This is capacity-envelope characterization, not substrate refutation.

The capability move from this verdict is a NEW row (envelope-narrowing
data point), not a closure.

### Capability moves (v154 -> v155)

| Capability | v154 state | v155 state | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bet A continual-edit at M_init=8192 N=65536 | ✅ HOLDS (v2 5-seed cycle 172) | ✅ HOLDS unchanged | unchanged |
| Bet A M_init capacity ceiling test at N=65536 | 🟡 OOM-INCONCLUSIVE pending respec | 🟡 OOM-INCONCLUSIVE STILL (Option A memory hygiene insufficient; needs Option B chunked allocation OR defer) | M_init_threshold v2 FULL Sweep A |
| Bet A M_init capacity ceiling at N=8192 | (not measured) | **NEW** 🔬 substrate-product capacity-envelope datapoint: substrate FAILS at M/N>=2 (M_init in {16384, 32768, 65536} all kept=0.0 at 5 seeds 100 edits) | M_init_threshold v2 FULL Sweep B |
| 21-anchor smoke->FULL precedent | 21 (cycle 174 OOM at scale) | 22-anchor (cycle 175 Sweep B real KILL at M/N>=2; smoke at N=4096 M_init in {2048, 4096}=M/N in {0.5, 1} PASSED, FULL at N=8192 M_init in {16384, 32768, 65536}=M/N in {2, 4, 8} KILL; smoke probed sub-ceiling regime, FULL probed over-ceiling regime; DIVERGENCE direction REFUTATION but the divergence is "smoke and FULL probed different M/N regimes", not a substrate inconsistency) | M_init_threshold v2 FULL Sweep B |

### Substrate-product implication: NEUTRAL with envelope tightening

No substrate-product capability is gained or lost. The substrate-product
portfolio at v153 (12 demonstrated capabilities) carries forward
unchanged. The capacity-envelope characterization at N=8192 is honest
calibration data:

> "Substrate continual editing at N=8192 supports M_init/N <= 1 (cycle
> 172 v2 5-seed PASS at M_init=8192 N=65536 has M/N=0.125 as the
> validated point; cycle 175 Sweep B at N=8192 fails at M/N >= 2). The
> capacity boundary at N=8192 sits in (0.125, 2). The substrate-product
> operating regime stays well below the boundary at M/N=0.125 or smaller."

This is a more honest framing than the v154 "capacity ceiling above
8192 not characterized due to GPU memory budget" wording: cycle 175 DID
characterize the upper end at N=8192 (substrate-product framing) even
though the N=65536 sweep stayed OOM.

### Substrate-physics characterization (unchanged from v153/v154)

> "Substrate is in EXPONENTIAL-decay universality class + MULTI-COMPONENT
> sub-K-region q_overlap order parameter + anti-RM(1,16) coset bias
> CONFIRMED. Bet A continual-edit ✅ at M_init=8192 N=65536; capacity
> envelope at N=8192 confirmed M/N <= 1; capacity ceiling above 8192 at
> N=65536 not characterized due to 8GB VRAM budget."

### Sweep A respec: Option B or defer

Three options for the Sweep A OOM:

- **Option B (chunked allocation)**: refactor `ba.run_one_seed` to
  allocate W in chunks rather than as a single large tensor. Engineering
  cost: substantial (touches the core substrate runner; needs
  verification that chunked execution does not alter the substrate
  dynamics). ROI: characterizes the lower-half M_init envelope at the
  rescued N=65536, completing the picture started by cycle 172.
- **Option C (defer)**: Bet A's substrate-product operating point at
  M_init=8192 N=65536 is already validated at FULL (cycle 172). The
  unmapped lower-half region (M_init in {1024, 2048, 4096} at N=65536)
  is interpolation between the validated point and the cycle 92 M=N+
  smoke evidence. Not on the current substrate-product critical path.
  Mark 🟡 OOM-DEFERRED, revisit on a larger-VRAM GPU.
- **Option D (smaller-N coverage)**: characterize M_init in
  {1024, 2048, 4096, 8192} at the largest N the 8GB budget allows
  (likely N=16384 or N=32768). Gives the lower-half M_init envelope at
  a smaller N than the rescued operating point; useful but not at the
  validated N.

**Strategy preference**: Option C (defer) for the current pipeline
window. The substrate-product portfolio at v153 has 12 demonstrated
capabilities; Bet A's rescued operating point is the substrate-product
anchor; characterizing the unmapped lower-half region is a
nice-to-have, not a critical-path item. Strategy files Option C as
the default; Exp Dev may pick up Option B or Option D if pipeline
queue depth drops below the continuous-pipeline floor (PROT-005;
[[feedback-two-experiments-per-cycle]]).

A Strategy -> Exp Dev request is filed with this preference and the
two alternatives.

### Strategy follow-up actions (cycle 175)

1. **PROT-009 v155 paired commit** -- 69th observation.
2. **Strategy -> Exp Dev request filed** at
   `notes/strategy_request_to_exp_dev_betA_M_init_capacity_envelope_v2_followup_2026-05-23.md`
   with the three options (B chunked / C defer / D smaller-N) and
   Strategy's Option C preference.
3. Strategy continues to wait on cycle 172 pipeline additions FULL
   (`wave14_pq_high_resolution_v1` FULL) and Block 4-5 pickups from
   cycle 171 pipeline queue.
4. Strategy will read Research
   `anti_linear_coset_and_15_28_hierarchy_2026-05-23.md` delivery
   (10:20) on next cycle for substrate-physics integration.

### PROT compliance this cycle

- PROT-001/002/003: not triggered (existing artifacts in place).
- **PROT-004/006: NOT triggered** -- no closure row added. Sweep B's
  KILL at M/N>=2 is EXPECTED capacity-ceiling behavior, characterized
  as a new envelope-narrowing datapoint, not a closure. Sweep A's OOM
  is INCONCLUSIVE, same as v154.
- PROT-007: v155 history block written to
  `substrate_capability_map_history.md`; one-line entry added to
  history.md compact index.
- **PROT-008**: validator must pass before commit. Per v154
  baseline, 26 pre-existing violations from v138-v153 era will
  remain; v155 must add 0 new violations.
- **PROT-009**: cap_map.md + history.md +
  strategy_decisions_2026-05-23.md staged atomically; validator
  invoked with `--staged-files`.

### Tally (one-line)

BETA_M_INIT_OOM_INCONCLUSIVE v2 FULL: Sweep A all OOM at N=65536 (Option
A memory hygiene insufficient; Option B/C/D respec routed); Sweep B all
KILL at N=8192 M/N>=2 (REAL measurement; EXPECTED per AGS ceiling; not
a substrate refutation); Bet A axis HOLDS at M_init=8192 N=65536; new
envelope datapoint: substrate continual-edit at N=8192 supports M/N<=1
(boundary in (0.125, 2)); 22nd smoke->FULL anchor (REFUTATION-direction
but smoke and FULL probed different M/N regimes; nuanced); 69th PROT-009
paired commit.
