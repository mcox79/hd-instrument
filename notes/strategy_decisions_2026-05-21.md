# Strategy session — decision log

Owner: Strategy session. One entry per cycle. META reads to audit coherence.

## Cycle 1 — 2026-05-21 cold start (~08:00)

### What I observed

- `MEMORY.md` and all linked feedback / project / reference files. No
  surprises; existing protocols apply (no-smoke, value-not-competition,
  multi-probe for memory claims, cap-map update protocol, etc.).
- `substrate_capability_map.md` (mtime 2026-05-21 07:27) is current
  through v11. v11 ended with a retraction batch (soft-trace calibration,
  counterfactual=1.00 tautology, Yonelinas dual-process queued for proper
  re-test).
- `data/session_events.jsonl` on remote (local copy stale at 2026-05-19).
  Last `experiment_outcome` event: 2026-05-21T07:27:02 —
  `wave14yonelinas_roc_v2` mode=full → `YONELINAS_PURE_FAMILIARITY`
  (z-slope=1.11, retraction confirmed).
- `data/needs_verdict.json` (remote) shows 50 experiments completed with
  metrics but without `experiment_outcome` events emitted. Many were
  narratively absorbed by user-driven cap_map updates v9-v11. Three I
  inspected directly via metrics.json:
  - `wave14walsh_peaks_extended` — recall=1.0 at every K in {50..4000}
  - `wave14g_acf K=8192/12288` — both 100% recovery at K/N=2.0 and 3.0
  - `wave14counterfactual_chain` — fidelity=1.0 (confirms tautology;
    same retracted claim as v11)
- `notes/experiment_dev_blocker.md` (mtime 07:57) — Experiment Dev is
  explicitly waiting for `notes/active_priorities.md` (absent until now).
- `notes/meta_audit_2026-05-21.md` (mtime 07:57) — META noted the same
  absences (active_priorities.md, dashboard snapshot, session prompts).
- `notes/next_experiments_recommendations.md` (mtime 2026-05-20 23:26) —
  legacy synthesis-session file; carries useful retraction history but
  is NOT the active_priorities.md the charter specifies for this session.

### What I decided

1. **Updated `substrate_capability_map.md` to v12** (atomic write + commit
   + scp). Three triggers:
   - Yonelinas dual-process: ❌ Closed (event-logged trigger, kill switch
     from v11 fires). The promotion to ✅ in v10 is retracted.
   - Walsh-peak forensics: evidence list extended from "low-K only" to
     "all K in [50..4000] at recall=1.0" (metrics.json strengthens the
     existing ✅ row).
   - ACF rescue: evidence list extended to K/N=2.0 and K/N=3.0 at 100%
     (≥3× the vanilla cliff, ceiling not yet located).
2. **Created `notes/active_priorities.md`** (NEW; unblocks Experiment
   Dev). Top 3 bets:
   - Bet 1: ICL saturation curve at extended N (closes Tier-S #1)
   - Bet 2: GDPR/surgical erase v3 (anti-Hebbian and selective anneal
     both closed by Mirage tests; new mechanism needed)
   - Bet 3: Substrate forensics extended (random-key iterative
     charge-flipping for the high-K gap)
   Plus retracted list, open research questions, open experiment requests.
3. **Did NOT touch** the 47 needs_verdict.json items that lack
   `experiment_outcome` events. Per cap_map protocol, the trigger is the
   events log. Strategy will integrate as event_outcomes land. Flagged
   this gap in v12 update for Visibility's awareness.

### Why (linking to evidence)

- Yonelinas retraction: v11 explicitly framed `wave14yonelinas_roc_v2` as
  the kill switch ("If z-slope ~ 1, it confirms the earlier 'validation'
  was a codebook-size artifact and that claim also gets retracted").
  Full-mode landed at z-slope=1.11. The kill criterion fires. Not
  retracting would violate `feedback_no_smoke` and `feedback_step_back_eval`.
- Walsh-peak / ACF strengthening: v9 and v8 framings were conservative.
  Extended sweeps now show the capabilities hold across the full tested
  range. Per cap_map protocol "Update evidence lists with new experiment
  names" — allowed change.
- Bet 2 framing: two independent negatives this week
  (`wave14d_query_side_integration` 93% leak; `wave14g_erase_under_replay`
  100% replay-erased-visit) + Mirage failures in both anti-Hebbian and
  selective-anneal recipes (`wave14p_erase_multiprobe`,
  `wave14anneal_selective`) mean the next attempt needs a different
  mechanism family, not a parameter tune. Per `feedback_rehabilitation_after_rejection`,
  I listed several axis-combination rescues (Kerdock-structured,
  iterative charge-flipping, ROME-style, per-fact orthogonal-subspace)
  before declaring the capability structurally closed.
- Active priorities length (162 lines) overshoots the charter target
  (50-100). Kept because of the substantial retraction list and
  experiment request set; willing to compress next cycle if META flags it.

### Open items / handoffs

- **Visibility session**: dashboard snapshot file is absent. Several
  downstream sessions reference it. Strategy is unblocked but operating
  on direct remote SSH reads instead.
- **Research session**: see Bet 2's R1 question (which GDPR-erase
  mechanism family) and R2/R3/R4 in active_priorities.md.
- **Experiment Dev**: blocker should be resolved as of this cycle. E1
  through E5 listed in active_priorities.md with multi-probe criteria.
- **Queue Health**: 50 unprocessed needs_verdict items + `session_events.jsonl`
  appears to not be receiving event_outcomes for most experiments. May
  warrant a check for whether the events-emission path is wedged.

### Next cycle plan

- Re-read session_events.jsonl for new outcomes; check
  `wave14d_icl_via_pool_v3_scaling` if it lands.
- Re-read research notes (synthesis output from Research session, if any).
- Audit whether Bet 2's R1 mechanism question has progressed (Research
  output expected).
- If 3+ needs_verdict items get backfilled with event_outcomes, integrate
  them into cap_map v13.
