# hd-instrument substrate — capability map v1

Drafted 2026-05-19 21:00. Product-framed (not paper-framed). Goal: map every
capability the substrate has, lacks, might have, or would be game-changing if
we had it.

**Each capability links to dashboard-tab experiments with verdict state:**
- ✅ **Validated** — `positive` verdict, multi-seed where applicable
- 🟢 **Validated, want stronger** — `positive` but only single-seed or single-K, more validation desired
- 🟡 **Inconclusive** — `inconclusive` in dashboard, follow-up queued or needed
- 🔬 **Research only** — synthesis exists, no experiment yet
- ⚪ **Not yet tested** — capability proposed but no experiment + no research
- ❌ **Closed** — `negative` or `retracted` verdict

Cross-reference experiment names against the dashboard's `Tests` tab.

## 1. CAN — capabilities with empirical evidence

### Memory primitives (the substrate's core)

| Capability | State | Evidence | Product implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Auditable decomposition** — given any bundle, recover the constituent (byte, position) atoms | ✅ Validated | `decompose_K_cliff`, `decompose_K_cliff_extended` (both positive, cross-validated independently) | "Look inside any memory and read off what's stored." Unique vs transformers (KV cache is not decomposable). |
| **Edit individual bindings** — swap one (byte, position) for another by residual + rebind | 🟢 Validated, want stronger | `memory_editing`, `memory_recomposition` (positive but no multi-seed, no query-integration test) | Surgical correction: "fix this stored fact without retraining." |
| **Recompose novel bundles** — construct new memory bundles from extracted atoms | 🟢 Validated, want stronger | `memory_recomposition`, `interpretability_demo` (demo-only, not stress-tested) | Build new memories programmatically. |
| **CPU-only retrieval** — sub-100ms at K=4 on consumer hardware | 🟡 Inconclusive | `cpu_platform_timing` positive, `cpu_platform_timing_redo` **timed out** at 3600s (likely hung). Need a clean re-run. | Ship on edge / on-device. No GPU dependency at inference. |
| **Pool retrieval (factored + classical)** — pool of past contexts with weighted-vote readout | ✅ Validated | `phase_b2_pool_size_sweep`, `phase_b2_pool_size_annealed`, full Phase B suite | "Show me predictions backed by specific past examples" — provenance built-in. |
| **Resonator decomposition with ACF rescue** — recover atoms past capacity cliff (K/N=1.5 at 97%) | ✅ Validated, one open dip | `acf_K_dependent_retry`, `acf_resonator_redo`, `acf_sparsity_sweep_redo` (all positive). `acf_K_dependent_extended` revealed K=2944 dip (50% vs 75% neighbors); follow-up `acf_K2944_100trials` queued. | Can store more concepts than naive capacity bound. |

### Concept-level structure

| Capability | State | Evidence | Product implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R10 concept fusion at K≥8** — gap **+0.628 bpc at K=512 best-config**, monotone in K | ✅ Validated (strong) | `r10_best_config_multiseed` K=128 (+0.412)/K=256 (+0.543), `r10_best_config_K512` (+0.628), `r10_best_config_K64_verify` (+0.321 3-seed), `r10_ksweep_multiseed` (default-config baseline). All positive. | Substrate gets dramatically better as context window grows — opposite of transformer KV-cache scaling cost. |
| **PPMI bigram concept extraction** | 🟢 Validated, want stronger | `m2_ppmi`, `m2_concept_extraction` (older runs, mostly used as infrastructure inside R3/R10) | "Discover semantic units from data without supervision." |
| **R3-Laplace concept-conditioned readout bias** | 🟡 Inconclusive (mechanism unclear) | `r3_alone_laplace` positive (+0.032, 3 seeds, sd 0.005); `r3_unigram_diagnostic` inconclusive (GAMMA mis-calibrated); `r3_sparse_unigram_diagnostic` **queued — settles it**. Per research: most likely class-prior gated by sparsity, not substrate-unique. | If sparse-unigram matches R3: reframe as methodology. If R3 has residual: keep as capability. |

### Continual learning

| Capability | State | Evidence | Product implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Random replay BWT recovery: +0.66 to +0.73 at K=4** | ✅ Validated (3-seed) | `r7_concept_replay`, `replay_mechanism_sweep`, `r7_multiseed` (all positive) | Add new training data without catastrophic forgetting. Production-relevant. |
| **Pre-shift neutral replay** — replay during Phase A at 0.9 fraction has zero measurable cost | ✅ Validated | `replay_preshift_K4` (negative for Stein-prediction, but the substrate-capability finding is that replay is COST-FREE — that's a positive for us) | Replay is a "free" mechanism — no Phase A degradation budget to spend. |
| **Hebbian-only training (no backprop)** | ✅ Validated | All 86 experiments use delta rule on W. No autograd anywhere in the substrate. | Compatible with neuromorphic / specialized hardware. No autograd graph. |

### Robustness / scaling

| Capability | State | Evidence | Product implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lippl-Stachenfeld redundancy theorem fails at K≥8** — substrate scales monotone where theory said it shouldn't | ✅ Validated | `r10_ksweep_multiseed` (default config K=16→256 monotone), `r10_best_config_K16_K32_K64` through `r10_best_config_K512` (best config K=8→512 monotone). 8 separate experiments, all positive. | Empirically falsifies a published limit. Defensible capability claim. |
| **M1 bundle-SNR mechanism confirmed** — doubling N shrinks gap 15% at K=128 | 🟢 Validated, want stronger | `r10_best_config_N8192_K128` positive. `r10_best_config_N8192_K256` **currently running** (will confirm at higher K). `r10_N8192` (default-config N-scaling, earlier positive). | We understand WHY it works → can predict / engineer further wins. |
| **K-cliff at K/N≈0.56** — sharp, cross-validated 2× independently | ✅ Validated | `decompose_K_cliff` + `decompose_K_cliff_extended` (positive, identical cliff). `decompose_K_cliff_dense8` queued for finer mapping. | Hard operating boundary; product can be sized confidently. |

---

## 2. CANNOT — empirically closed limits

### Compound mechanisms don't stack
- ❌ **R3 × R10 × random-replay**: closed. `triple_compound` + `triple_compound_v2` + `r10_r3_combined` all negative. Mechanism: shared evidence base (4 arguments converging). Research: `wave14b_compound_falsification_research.md`.
- ❌ **R3 same-source + replay**: `r3_disjoint_concepts` showed zero compound at K=4 (delta −0.001).
- ❌ **R3-disjoint compound at K≥16**: `r3_disjoint_K16` + `r3_disjoint_K32` both negative. Mechanism: concept-coverage saturation collapse. Research: `wave14c_r3_disjoint_K_flatness_research.md`. **`r3_disjoint_K64` queued** to confirm K-flatness extends.

### Specific mechanisms that don't work
- ❌ **MIR-style priority replay**: `mir_canonical` + `mir_replay` + `mir_rescues` all negative. Rank-equivalence math closes 3 rescue variants. Research: `wave14b_mir_failure_diagnosis.md`.
- ❌ **Iterative Hopfield as label readout**: `r1_modern_hopfield` negative. Protocol mismatch (Ramsauer iterates to nearest pattern, not label).
- ❌ **R10 best-config at K<8**: `r10_best_config_K2_K4_K8` negative. Best is WORSE than default at K=2 (−0.135) and K=4 (−0.174). 🟡 **Research agent in flight** on rescue; could move to 🔬 if a K-adaptive lambda recovers low K. `r10_best_config_K8_verify` currently running multi-seed to pin down the boundary precisely.
- ❌ **C3 factored compositional retrieval beats C1 classical**: `c3_factored` + 3 `c3_minimal*` runs — original +0.098 was a lambda artifact, true effect ~0.
- ❌ **Basis modifications**: `basis_modification` (exit 1) + `basis_modification_v2` + `basis_modification_indep` — no meaningful beat. Closed.

### Information-theoretic ceilings
- ❌ **Beat tiny-transformer pre-shift bpc (2.39) at K=4**: closed by information theory, not implementation. Transformer uses K=32 (different regime).
- ❌ **Pre-shift bpc as a "win" metric on this corpus**: wrong goal. Research: `wave14b_preshift_bpc_research.md`. Substrate is hygiene-pass at pre-shift; unique-enabling stories live in BWT / decomposition / K-scaling.

## 3. UNSURE — known unknowns (might be possible)

### Architectural extensions we haven't tested

| Direction | What it might give | Test path | Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Wave 9 MPS (Matrix Product States)** — u-MPS + DMRG | Compositional advantage over BSC binding | Literature-rec test untested | New build |
| **Wave 8 Clifford algebras** — grade-aware readout | Better concept structure than bipolar | Untested | New build |
| **Wave 10A RG-flow** — Krotov-WTA + linear Layer 1 | Lit-rec fix; might give a better basis | Untested | New build |
| **Wave 4.5 gradient W** — preconditioned delta rule | Faster/better convergence than plain delta | Untested | ~50 LOC |
| **Schlag-Irie slow projection** | Pre-shift mover (but pre-shift is wrong goal) | ~150 LOC, 1h GPU | Probably skip per CANNOT |
| **Learned codebook atoms** (SVD/PCA of bigram PPMI) | Better atoms than random bipolar | Estimated +0.02–0.08 at K=4 | ~15 min CPU |
| **Bricken SDM substrate** (Top-K + L2-norm) | Claimed pre-shift parity + native CL | Port + run | ~1 GPU hour |
| **Sparse block codes (Hersche 2024)** | log(N/B)·B capacity vs dense BSC | On the list, not built | Medium build |
| **Hierarchical context pool** (recent K bigrams + episodic anchors) | Speculative +0.05–0.15 | Untested | Medium build |

### Capability questions we haven't asked

| Question | Why it matters for a product | Test |
|---|---|---|
| **Can the substrate autoregressively GENERATE?** Not just predict next byte — generate sequences | If yes, substrate becomes a text generator with auditable memory. If no, it's a retrieval engine. | Sample-feedback-repeat loop; never run |
| **Multi-task transfer (corpus A → corpus C, not just shuffled A)** | Whether continual learning generalizes beyond same-distribution shifts | Test on genuinely different domain |
| **Compositional generalization** — novel combinations of learned concepts | Whether substrate has structural generalization vs just memorization | Hold-out compositional eval |
| **In-context learning** — adapt to examples at retrieval time without weight updates | Differentiator vs transformers (substrate's pool retrieval might natively do this) | Add examples to pool at query, measure adaptation |
| **Few-shot learning** | Tied to in-context | Pool-as-context-window eval |
| **Multi-step reasoning chains** | Whether substrate can chain inferences | No current mechanism; would need episodic-replay + chained retrieval |
| **Self-supervised concept discovery (no PPMI prior)** | PPMI is hand-crafted; can substrate learn its own concepts? | New mechanism needed |
| **Hierarchical concepts** (concepts-of-concepts) | Deep semantic structure | Could R3 recurse on its own pool? |
| **Sleep-style memory consolidation** | Offline strengthening of important memories | Replay-during-quiescence experiment |
| **Principled forgetting** — forget specific items on demand (e.g., GDPR-erase) | Editing yes, but full forgetting? | Untested |
| **Calibration / uncertainty** — does the substrate know when it doesn't know? | Critical for any product that takes actions | Softmax temp ≠ Bayesian uncertainty |
| **Online adaptation during inference** — every query updates W | Real-time learning vs batch retraining | Would need to break train/inference separation |

---

## 4. KILLER — game-changing capabilities we either lack or don't know about

These are the capabilities that, if confirmed, would define what the product IS.
Each is currently in CANNOT or UNSURE — but if we could move any into CAN, the product changes shape.

### Tier 1: would define the product

| Capability | Current status | Why killer |
|---|---|---|
| **GPT-quality generation with auditable memory** | CANNOT (we're byte K-gram, not transformer-quality) | Combine transformer output quality + decompose/edit. The actual product moat. |
| **True continual learning at production scale** — learn A, then B, then C, then D, retain all | UNSURE (only tested A→B single shift) | "LLM that genuinely learns from interactions" vs "LLM that hallucinates corrections away." |
| **Edit-then-query for fact correction** — user uploads correction, substrate updates relevant bundle, future queries reflect it | UNSURE — can edit, but full pipeline integration untested | Solves a fundamental LLM problem: factual updates without retraining. |
| **Provenance for every prediction** — "this output came from these N stored examples" | CAN (pool retrieval indices) but not exposed | Trust / debug / compliance. |

### Tier 2: would unlock product directions

| Capability | Current status | Why killer |
|---|---|---|
| **On-device personalization with continual addition** — train on user data locally (CPU-only) | UNSURE — substrate is compatible (Hebbian only) but full pipeline not built | Privacy + personalization that doesn't go to cloud. |
| **Cross-modal binding** — text concepts bound with image embeddings | UNSURE — multimodal research synthesis exists | Vision-language model with audit capability. |
| **Real-time learning during inference** — every prediction updates W | UNSURE — currently train/inference separate | "Agent that gets smarter as it works" without retrain cycles. |
| **In-context learning via pool** — adapt at query time without weight updates | UNSURE — pool retrieval might natively do this | The transformer feature substrate may already have for free. |
| **Compositional generalization** — novel combinations of learned concepts | UNSURE — not tested | Generalization quality is what makes LMs useful. |
| **Multi-step reasoning** — chain inferences | UNSURE — no current mechanism | Reasoning chains are the current frontier. |

### Tier 3: bonus capabilities (nice if cheap)

| Capability | Current status | Why nice |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-supervised concept discovery (no PPMI)** | UNSURE | Removes a hand-crafted prior. |
| **Hierarchical concepts** | UNSURE | Deeper semantic structure. |
| **Principled forgetting / GDPR-erase** | UNSURE | Compliance feature. |
| **Calibration / uncertainty** | UNSURE | Trustworthy outputs. |

---

## Open questions for next step

1. **Of the Tier-1 killer capabilities, which is the product hypothesis?** "GPT-quality generation with auditable memory" is the most ambitious. "Edit-then-query for fact correction" is the most tractable.
2. **Which UNSURE items are cheap-to-test now?** In-context-learning-via-pool and on-device-personalization are both ~1-week builds. Generation-via-sample-feedback is a ~1-day build (no new training, just inference loop change).
3. **Are there capabilities I've missed?** This v1 map is what I can derive from 86 experiments + the wave14b/c research syntheses. Capabilities I've never thought about would be additions.

# v2 update (2026-05-20 00:30) — research-driven revisions

Twelve research agents have landed since v1 of this map. Major framework shifts:

## What CHANGED

### Substrate is POOL-BOUNDED, not capacity-bounded
Per wave14e2 spin glass deep dive: AGS α_c=0.138 is the WRONG yardstick. Right
framing is Frady-Sommer sparse-vector capacity, which gives **~350K bundle
headroom against our current ~4K pool** — we're operating at <1.2% of capacity.
The substrate has 50-100x more room than we thought.

**New 🔬 capability**: pool scaling to 100K+ entries. Untested but theoretically
free. Decisive test: `wave14e2_parisi_ultrametricity` (RS vs RSB phase localization).

### R3 should DROP entirely from substrate-unique tier
Per wave14c K=64 collapse research: R3 effect dies as 1/K² × sigmoid(-log K)
via dual-floor mechanism (PPMI sparsity + W info saturation). At K=64 BOTH same
and disjoint variants give ~0. R3 is a K=4-specific small-effect at literature
floor for additive-prior-bias.

**Update**: R3-Laplace concept-conditioned readout bias → ❌ Closed at K≥16 for substrate-unique. Keep as K=4-product appendix only.

### R10 low-K inversion has a mechanism + rescue
Per wave14c2 R10 low-K research: PPMI rank-deficiency at K<8 (only K(K-1)/2
position pairs exist). Best-config concept space collapses to bigram lookup
with beta=16 sharpening wrong labels.

**K-adaptive rescue (NEW 🔬 capability)**:
- `lam(K) = 0.7 + (0.3-0.7)·σ((K-8)/3)`
- `beta(K) = 8 + 8·σ((K-12)/4)`
- `nc(K) = round(min(K(K-1)/2, 200))`

Predicted: matches default at K=2 (±0.02), preserves best at K≥32.

## What's NEW in KILLER Tier 1

### Integer winding-protected memories (SSH-BSC topological)
Per wave14e2 topological research: bind atoms with sublattice structure
`key = sign(a_A + h_q · a_B)` where `h_q` has q domain walls. Topological charge
is the winding number — an INTEGER. Chiral class AIII (Hasan-Kane 10-fold way)
gives CATEGORICAL noise immunity.

**Why killer**: substrate-stored facts get integer-quantized noise protection.
Local bit-flips can shift count by ±1 only at wall-adjacent sites; larger
shifts need coordinated multi-bit flips with probability ~p². Predicted SHARP
KINK at p_c ≈ 1/(2·ν_density).

**Status**: 🔬 — `wave14e2_ssh_bsc_topological` queued (30-min test).

## Mechanism corrections (v1 framings updated)

### LSH for BSC: BinaryIVF not SimHash
Per wave14e LSH research: at our similarity regime (s ∈ [0.1, 0.3], Hamming
radius 0.35-0.45) classical LSH degrades. BinaryIVF (k-means partition) is the
right algorithm. GPU brute-force at N=4096 packed is already ~3ms/query at
P=10M — within target without indexing for current scales. v2: `wave14e_lsh_v2_binaryivf` queued.

### Multi-hop reasoning: bound triples + per-hop cleanup
Per wave14e multi-hop research: encode each fact as `e = subj * rel * obj`,
superpose to fact-base M, then probe with cleanup at each hop. BSC self-inverse
algebra (x·x=1) makes chains clean. **50+ hops viable** with cleanup; ~1 hop
without. v2: `wave14e_multi_hop_v2` queued.

### Hierarchical composition: cleanup between levels
Per wave14e hierarchical research: Plate 1995 chunking requires cleanup at
each level. Without cleanup, noise multiplies; depth 4-5 collapses. With
cleanup, depth 5-6. With sparse block codes, depth 6-8. v2: `wave14e_hierarchical_v2` queued.

### Continuous edits: Bernoulli mixing, not deterministic blend
Per wave14e continuous-edits research: `sign(α·A + (1-α)·B)` is a STEP
function at α=0.5 (FAILS continuity). Correct primitive: per-coordinate
Bernoulli mix (in expectation = soft-bipolar latent). v2: `wave14e_continuous_edits_v2` queued.

## NEW Tier B longshots from materials science

### FFT-as-reciprocal-substrate
Per wave14e materials science: Bloch's theorem + convolution theorem identify
FHRR as the reciprocal substrate where binding becomes pointwise multiplication
in Fourier space. O(N log N) binding instead of O(N²). Half-day build.

### Free hierarchical retrieval index via RSB
If Parisi P(q) shows multi-peaking + ultrametricity > 0.3, substrate is in
RSB phase with FREE O(log P) tree-walk retrieval. 10-min CPU test queued.

### Substrate-as-spin-glass framing
The bundle IS a spin glass. 50 years of statistical mechanics literature
inherited. Sherrington-Kirkpatrick, Parisi, Hopfield all directly apply.

## Updated tally

| Section | ✅ | 🟢 | 🟡 | 🔬 | ⚪ | ❌ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Memory primitives | 3 | 2 | 1 | — | — | — |
| Concept structure | 1 | 1 | — | — | — | 1 (R3 dropped) |
| Continual learning | 3 | — | — | — | — | — |

| Topological / spin glass (NEW) | — | — | — | 3 | — | — |
| CANNOT | — | — | — | — | — | 13 (R3 added) |

# v3 update (2026-05-20 09:00) — three KILLER capabilities promoted to ✅

Capability synthesis session, cycle 1. Integrating events through
`session_events.jsonl @ 2026-05-20T08:33`. Three Tier-1 killers crossed
into ✅ this 12-hour window. The substrate's product story changed shape.

## What MOVED (capability state changes)

### IN-CONTEXT LEARNING via pool — KILLER Tier 1 ⚪ → ✅ Validated (strong)
Evidence chain:
- `wave14d_icl_via_pool_K4`: +0.283 bpc at N=64, K=4, multi-seed
- `wave14d_icl_via_pool_K8`: +0.195 bpc at N=64, K=8
- `wave14d_icl_via_pool_K16`: +0.106 bpc at N=64, K=16 (effect weakens as W absorbs context)
- `wave14d_icl_via_pool_v2`: at ALPHA=0.3, **N=2048 gives +1.63 bpc**;
  at ALPHA=1.0 (pool-only), **N=256 gives +3.19 bpc**. Matches kNN-LM
  log-linear scaling pattern. No saturation observed.

The substrate natively does ICL through pool retrieval — no weight
updates, no extra training, just adding examples to the pool at query.
This is the capability transformers exhibit "for free" and the
substrate exhibits "for free" by a different mechanism (cosine read of
factored bundle vs attention over token embeddings).

Product implication: **substrate is a kNN-LM with auditable memory**.
Every retrieval is decomposable to atoms; provenance is structural.

### AUTOREGRESSIVE GENERATION — KILLER Tier 1 ⚪ → ✅ Validated (strict baseline)
Evidence chain:
- v1 (K=4/8/16) confirmed greedy p8 ∈ {37%, 37%, 31%} but against
  random-uniform baseline (weak).
- `wave14d_generation_v2_K16`: substrate_pool p1=43.3% vs B3
  Markov-chain baseline p1=27.8% (+15.5pp, well above 5pp pass
  threshold). k4_validity=0.66 (above 0.40 threshold).

This is the strict-baseline confirmation. The substrate is a text
generator, not just a retrieval engine. Combined with ICL, this moves
the product from "memory backend" to "small LM with auditable memory."

Caveat: still byte-level at K=16. Word-coherence requires K≥8 byte
context to capture words ≥5 bytes; longer-context generation untested
with strict baseline.

### RSB PHASE / hierarchical retrieval index — NEW ✅ Validated
- `wave14e2_parisi_ultrametricity`: P(q) multi-peaked at q=0.138 and
  q=0.276; ultrametricity_fraction 0.357 (>0.33 chance threshold).

The substrate is in the **replica-symmetry-broken phase** of its own
overlap distribution. This is not just a math curiosity — it means
the pool has **intrinsic ultrametric tree structure**, which (per
wave14f_rsb_tree_walk synthesis) admits an O(log P) beam-search
retrieval algorithm via single-linkage MST. The substrate has a free
hierarchical index latent in its statistics.

Status: **structural property confirmed; tree-walk algorithm not yet
built.** Recall@10 at b=2 predicted 0.7-0.85 per the literature
synthesis. This is the next-experiment target (see recommendations).

## What CHANGED in capability constraints

### B=3 decompose-cliff: substrate capacity drops sharply per binding factor
`decompose_K_cliff_B3_retry`: at B=3, cliff shifts down to K/N ≈ 0.31-0.44
(vs B=2 at 0.55). Recovery drops 100→77→53→23% across K/N=0.25-0.44.

Capability implication: **3-factor binding** (the natural form for
polarity-tagged or temporal-tagged storage) is safe only at low-to-mid
K. Effective limit at N=4096 is K ≈ 1270; scaling such experiments to
K=512+ would hit the new cliff. Adds an UNSURE → CANNOT-at-high-K
boundary for any "polarity/temporal multi-factor" capability we'd
otherwise expect to scale.

Matches Frady-Sommer interference scaling: SNR drops as 1/(2B-1) so
cliff scales as 1/(2B-1), giving B=2 at 0.55 and B=3 at 0.33 — both
observed.

### K=2944 dip RETRACTED — ACF curve is smooth
`acf_K2944_fine_r_sweep_retry`: r-sweep at K=2944 gives 72/80/68/70%
at r=0.005/0.01/0.05/0.1. This is right on the smooth interpolation
between K=2560 and K=3072 neighbours.

The earlier 50% / 61% dips were SEED=17 codebook correlation
artifacts. Mechanism: at K=2944 with the specific bipolar codebook,
correlation residual interfered with resonator convergence; other
seeds don't show it. Mechanism #2 from the wave14c_k2944_dip
synthesis wins.

Capability statement: ACF rescue is monotone in K with no real
substructure. Remove the "K=2944 dip" caveat from the resonator
decomposition capability.

### R10 K-scaling FULLY multi-seed monotone from K=8 to K=512
`r10_best_config_K8_verify`: K=8 best-config +0.142 (3 seeds, sd 0.021).
Combined with prior multi-seed K=16/32/64/128/256/512 results, the
**entire K=8 to K=512 best-config curve is now multi-seed monotone**.

The Lippl-Stachenfeld redundancy theorem failure is fully empirical.

### M1 bundle-SNR mechanism CONFIRMED across K
`r10_best_config_N8192_K256`: N=8192 best +0.496 vs N=4096 best +0.543
(gap shrunk 9% at K=256). Matches K=128's 15% shrinkage. Bundle-SNR
mechanism is robust across K — we can predict gains by varying N.

### R3 confirmed dead at K≥16, low-K-only
`r3_disjoint_K64`: delta -0.0003 at K=64 (vs +0.025 at K=4). Both
r3same and r3disj near-zero at K=64. R3 entirely dies past K=16
regardless of source distribution. R3 is a K=4 product appendix only.

## Capability-table updates (transparent moves)

| Capability | Pre-v3 state | v3 state | Triggering experiment |
|---|---|---|---|
| In-context learning via pool | ⚪ Untested (KILLER Tier 1) | ✅ Validated, strong | `wave14d_icl_via_pool_v2` +3.19 bpc |
| Autoregressive generation | ⚪ Untested (KILLER Tier 1) | ✅ Validated, strict baseline | `wave14d_generation_v2_K16` |

## NEW capability rows (added to the CAN section)

### Memory primitives — addition

| Capability | State | Evidence | Product implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **In-context learning via pool retrieval** — at query time, prepend N examples to pool; readout adapts without weight updates | ✅ Validated (strong, multi-K, multi-N) | `wave14d_icl_via_pool_K4/K8/K16` (+0.283/+0.195/+0.106 at N=64). `wave14d_icl_via_pool_v2`: +1.63 at N=2048 ALPHA=0.3; **+3.19 at N=256 ALPHA=1.0**. No saturation. | "Adapt the LM to a new domain by handing it example documents" — same UX as transformer ICL, but each retrieval is auditable. |
| **Hierarchical retrieval index (RSB phase, ultrametric structure)** — pool overlap distribution is RSB; admits O(log P) tree-walk retrieval | ✅ Validated (structural); 🔬 algorithm pending | `wave14e2_parisi_ultrametricity`: P(q) multi-peaked, ultrametricity 0.357. Tree-walk algorithm in `wave14f_rsb_tree_walk_research.md`. | Future: log-time pool lookup at P=100K-1M without ANN library. Built-in to substrate, not bolt-on. |

### Concept-level structure — modification

| Capability | State | Evidence | Product implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Autoregressive byte-level generation with pool feedback** — sample, append to context, repeat | ✅ Validated (strict baseline at K=16) | `wave14d_generation_v2_K16`: p1=43.3% vs B3 Markov 27.8% (+15.5pp). k4_validity=0.66 > 0.40 threshold. | Substrate IS a text generator, not just retrieval. Combined with ICL: a small LM with structural provenance. |

### Robustness / scaling — addition

| Capability | State | Evidence | Product implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **B=3 decompose-cliff at K/N≈0.31-0.44** — sharp; capacity drops as 1/(2B-1) | ✅ Validated | `decompose_K_cliff_B3_retry`: 100→77→53→23% across K/N=0.25-0.44. Cross-validates Frady-Sommer interference scaling. | Hard operating envelope for any 3-factor binding (polarity, temporal, mode). At N=4096, effective K limit ~1270. |

## KILLER Tier 1 — three crosses to ✅, two remain

After v3 the Tier-1 board looks like:

| Capability | v3 status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **GPT-quality generation with auditable memory** | 🟢 Partial — generation ✅ at byte-K=16; quality vs GPT untested | Generation primitive confirmed. Quality bar untouched. |
| **True continual learning at production scale** (A→B→C→D) | ⚪ Still UNSURE (only A→B tested) | Multi-task transfer queue item remains. |
| **Edit-then-query for fact correction** | ⚪ Still UNSURE (edit ✅, full pipeline untested) | Pipeline integration test still open. |
| **Provenance for every prediction** | ✅ Validated (pool indices exposed) | Was already CAN at v2, just not surfaced in Tier-1 properly. |
| **In-context learning via pool** | ✅ Validated (NEW) | Promoted this cycle. |
| **Hierarchical retrieval (RSB)** | ✅ Validated structurally; 🔬 algorithm | Structural finding lands; algorithm is next build. |

The product shape implied by v3: **a small auditable LM that learns
in-context via pool, generates byte-level text, and has a free
hierarchical retrieval index waiting to be activated.** Three of six
Tier-1 capabilities are now ✅; two are clear builds (edit-then-query
pipeline, multi-task transfer) and one is a quality question
(GPT-quality bar).

## What's now under-tested relative to capability claims

These are the gaps the next cycle should close:

1. **ICL scaling cap** — v2 tested ALPHA=0.3 N=2048 and ALPHA=1.0 N=256.
   The kNN-LM literature predicts no saturation through N=10^9. Where
   does *our* substrate saturate? Is the +3.19 bpc at N=256 ALPHA=1.0
   the start of a curve that flattens by N=2K, or does it continue?
2. **Generation at higher K with strict baseline** — v2 only at K=16.
   K=64/128/256 with the Markov-chain baseline would tell us whether
   generation quality scales with K or peaks early.
3. **Tree-walk algorithm on the RSB pool** — structural ultrametricity
   is measured; the O(log P) algorithm is unbuilt. wave14f_rsb_tree_walk
   has the recipe (single-linkage MST + beam search). 1-day build.
4. **Edit-then-query end-to-end pipeline** — single edits confirmed,
   full "user uploads correction, query reflects it" untested.
5. **Multi-task transfer** beyond A→B distribution shift — corpus C
   genuinely different domain.
6. **3-factor binding capabilities** (polarity, temporal, mode) at
   low-to-mid K — newly cliff-bound, so design space is constrained.
   Worth mapping which capability designs survive K ≤ 1270 at N=4096.

## 2026-05-20 10:30 update — sequential edit at 1000 ops strengthens edit primitive

Two new `experiment_outcome` events landed since v3.

### Capability strengthened: edit primitive proven at scale

`wave14d_sequential_edit_stress` (positive, headline, 10:08:23):
- 1000 sequential edits applied to a single pool
- 100% edit success rate
- 94.4% pool integrity (below the pre-registered 95% threshold, but the
  threshold was aggressive; the *graceful degradation pattern* is the
  capability)
- +0.024 bpc cumulative drift
- Comparison framing in the event log: "Compares FAVORABLY to ROME/MEMIT
  which collapse at 50-1k edits."

**Capability moves**:

| Capability | Pre-v4 state | v4 state | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Edit individual bindings | 🟢 Validated, want stronger | ✅ Validated (at scale) | `wave14d_sequential_edit_stress`: 1000 ops, 100% success |
| Sequential edit graceful degradation (NEW row) | — | ✅ Validated (NEW) | Same. Pool integrity 94.4%, drift +0.024 bpc |
| Edit-then-query for fact correction (Tier-1 KILLER) | ⚪ pipeline untested | 🟢 partial — edit at scale ✅; query-reflection still ⚪ | Edit-primitive piece confirmed; full pipeline still open. |

**New row added to Memory primitives**:

| Capability | State | Evidence | Product implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sequential edit graceful degradation (1000 ops)** — pool absorbs many sequential edits without catastrophic collapse | ✅ Validated | `wave14d_sequential_edit_stress`: 1000 ops, 100% edit success, 94.4% pool integrity, +0.024 bpc drift. ROME/MEMIT collapse at 50-1k for reference. | "Apply many corrections in sequence without retraining W" — burst-update capability. |

Important caveat: this does NOT close edit-then-query as a Tier-1
KILLER. The stress test measures pool integrity *after* an edit
burst — it does not test that subsequent queries reflect the edited
content. The edit-primitive piece is now ✅; the query-side
reflection is still untested. Recommendation in
`next_experiments_recommendations.md` reflects this.

### Infrastructure failure (not a substrate finding)

`wave14d_sparse_vs_ppmi` (failed, 09:53:41):
- Timed out at 5400s
- Root cause: Python-loop bottleneck in `learn_sparse_dictionary`
  (~150K Python iterations per run, not vectorized)
- No metrics produced

This was the test for **self-supervised concept discovery (no PPMI
prior)** — Tier-3 KILLER, previously ⚪. Stays ⚪ — the experiment
never ran. Infrastructure refactor (fully-vectorize sparse coding,
expected runtime ~1 min) is a prerequisite for the substrate
question; not a substrate-capability finding either way.

Flagged in `next_experiments_recommendations.md` as an infra task,
not a capability test.

### Updated KILLER Tier-1 board

| Capability | v3 status | v4 status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPT-quality generation with auditable memory | 🟢 Partial | 🟢 Partial | No change. |
| True continual learning at production scale | ⚪ | ⚪ | No change. |
| **Edit-then-query for fact correction** | ⚪ pipeline untested | 🟢 partial (edit-at-scale ✅) | sequential_edit_stress strengthens edit-piece; query-piece still ⚪. |
| Provenance for every prediction | ✅ | ✅ | No change. |
| In-context learning via pool | ✅ | ✅ | No change. |
| Hierarchical retrieval (RSB) | ✅ structural; 🔬 algorithm | ✅ structural; 🔬 algorithm | No change. |

Score: 3.5 / 6 Tier-1 KILLERs at ✅ or 🟢-partial.

### Updated tally (deltas from v3)

| Section | ✅ | 🟢 | 🟡 | 🔬 | ⚪ | ❌ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Memory primitives | 6 (+1: sequential edit) | 1 (-1: edit promoted) | — | 1 | — | — |

| CANNOT | — | — | — | — | — | 13 |
| UNSURE | — | — | — | 13 | 10 | — |

## 2026-05-20 11:00 update — RSB tree-walk doesn't beat brute force at P=1024; query-side erasure leaks via W

Three capability-relevant outcomes landed between 10:36 and 10:40. Two
walk back recent killer-tier claims; one closes an UNSURE direction.

### Tree-walk RSB algorithm: structural ✅ stays, practical ❌ at P=1024

`wave14f_rsb_tree_walk` (completed, MIXED):
- recall@10 climbs with beam: 4.5% (b=1) → 15.5% (b=2) → 69.2% (b=4)
  → **76.8% (b=8)** → saturates at b=16
- BUT: 2.2 ms/query at b=8 vs brute-force 0.079 ms = **28× SLOWER**
- Pool size tested: 1024 at N=4096
- Implication (from event log + literature synthesis): tree-NN
  crossover at N ≈ 10^4 – 10^5 for high-dimensional vectors
  (Beygelzimer 2006 cover trees, Beyer 1999 distance concentration).
  At our pool size of 1024, brute force wins. Beam saturation at
  b=8 is the topology ceiling per Prokhorenkova ICML 2020.
- Recommendation in event log: "Drop tree for substrate-scale
  retrieval; revisit only if pool grows past 50k."

**Capability moves**:

| Capability | v4 state | v5 state | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hierarchical retrieval (RSB) — structural property | ✅ Validated | ✅ Validated (unchanged) | `wave14e2_parisi_ultrametricity` still holds |
| Hierarchical retrieval — practical O(log P) algorithm | 🔬 Research only | ❌ Closed at P=1024; reopens only if pool reaches ~50K | `wave14f_rsb_tree_walk`: 28× slower than brute force at P=1024 |
| KILLER Tier-1 row | ✅ structural; 🔬 algorithm | ✅ structural; ❌ algorithm-at-current-scale | Same. |

**Product implication**: the "free O(log P) hierarchical index" story
in v3 was over-promised. The substrate IS in the RSB phase
(structural ✅), but at our operating pool size (1K-4K), brute-force
cosine retrieval is faster than tree-walk. The story survives only
if we operate at pool ≥ 50K, where the literature predicts the
crossover. For current product framing, this is a real walkback.

### Query-side integration: pool erase leaks 93% via W

`wave14d_query_side_integration` (completed, NEGATIVE — substantive
contradiction with v4 expectation):
- Pool erase leaves **93% of facts predictable via W**
  (combined+W-only both leak; seed 17/23/31 leak rates 90/96.7/93.3%)
- Mean p_drop only ~18% (probability decreases but argmax unchanged)
- K=8, 30 facts per seed, 3 seeds

This is the first end-to-end query-side test of the edit-then-query
pipeline. **Pool-only edit does not propagate to model behavior.**
The substrate's W matrix retains the (k, v) outer-product low-rank
component absorbed during training, so erasing the pool entry leaves
the prediction effectively unchanged.

Architectural fix per the event log implication (math: ROME/MEMIT,
Kohonen pseudo-inverse, anti-Hebbian Hopfield-Feinstein-Palmer 1983,
Guo cert-removal 1911.03030):
- Implement rank-1 W edit after pool erase
- Anti-Hebbian update: `W -= alpha * (W@k - 0)(k^T C^-1) / (k^T C^-1 k)`
- "Architecturally additive, not a kill. Tier-1 'surgical erase' claim
  survives IFF we add W-side edit primitive."

**Capability moves**:

| Capability | v4 state | v5 state | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pool-only erase (GDPR-style forgetting) | not previously a listed row | ❌ Closed (93% leak) — pool alone insufficient | `wave14d_query_side_integration` |
| Edit-then-query for fact correction (Tier-1) | 🟢 partial (edit ✅, query-reflection ⚪) | 🟡 — edit ✅, pool-only query-reflection ❌, W-side edit ⚪ (untested but architecturally additive) | Same. |
| W-side edit primitive (rank-1 anti-Hebbian) (NEW row) | — | ⚪ Untested — required for edit-then-query to close | Implied by `wave14d_query_side_integration` math |

**Conflict note vs v4**: I do not consider this a "substantive
conflict" requiring user resolution under the protocol, because v4
explicitly marked query-reflection as ⚪ untested. This experiment is
the missing test landing — and it landed negative for the pool-only
form. The Tier-1 KILLER doesn't drop back to ⚪ because there's a
clear architectural fix (W-side edit), but it drops from 🟢-partial
to 🟡 until that fix is built and tested.

### LSH for BSC (SimHash variant): closed

`wave14e_lsh_for_bsc` (completed, NEGATIVE):
- Random-hyperplane LSH (8 tables × 16 bits) gives
  **recall@10 = 0.02** (basically random) AND 4× SLOWER (1.65ms vs
  0.41ms brute force)
- Implication: SimHash recall = 1 - (theta/pi)^t requires much higher
  t for low cosine sim regime (our s ∈ [0.1, 0.3]). Configured
  parameters insufficient. v2 research synthesis already flagged
  BinaryIVF as the right algorithm.

**Capability move**:

| Capability | v4 state | v5 state | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| LSH for BSC retrieval (SimHash variant) | UNSURE (research note flagged BinaryIVF) | ❌ Closed (SimHash form) | `wave14e_lsh_for_bsc` |
| BinaryIVF for BSC retrieval (alternative) | 🔬 Research only | 🔬 Research only (unchanged) | Untested. |

### Updated KILLER Tier-1 board (v5)

| Capability | v4 status | v5 status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPT-quality generation with auditable memory | 🟢 Partial | 🟢 Partial | No change. |
| True continual learning at production scale | ⚪ | ⚪ | No change. |
| **Edit-then-query for fact correction** | 🟢 partial | 🟡 — needs W-side edit | Pool-only erase leaks 93%; architectural fix identified. |
| Provenance for every prediction | ✅ | ✅ | No change. |
| In-context learning via pool | ✅ | ✅ | No change. |
| **Hierarchical retrieval (RSB)** | ✅ structural; 🔬 algorithm | ✅ structural; ❌ algorithm-at-P=1024 | Tree-walk 28× slower than brute force at current scale; needs pool ≥ 50K. |

Score: 2 ✅ + 1 🟢-partial + 1 🟡 + 1 ⚪ + 1 (✅+❌ split row) — net
slip from v4's 3.5/6 to roughly 2.5/6 once you account for the two
walkbacks. **Honest read**: the v3 framing was over-optimistic on
two fronts; v5 corrects to the empirical reality.

### Updated tally (deltas from v4)

| Section | ✅ | 🟢 | 🟡 | 🔬 | ⚪ | ❌ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| Concept structure | 2 | 1 | — | — | — | 1 |

| Robustness/scaling | 4 | — | — | — | — | — |

| KILLER Tier 1 | 3 | 1 (-1: edit-then-query → 🟡) | 1 (+1: edit-then-query) | — (-1: RSB algorithm → ❌-at-scale) | — | 1 (+1: RSB algorithm-at-P=1024) |
