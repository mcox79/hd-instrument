Rules: `STATUS_SPEC.md`; stubs resolve in `STATUS_LESSONS.md` (uncapped). Cap 8704 B, OVER -- see
WHAT IS RUNNING. FOUR literals MACHINE-PARSED, never reword: `AS OF:`, `## POSITION`, `## TOP ITEM`,
`## WHAT IS RUNNING` (`session_start_hook.py`, `board.py`).
CHAIN: `PLAN_ORGAN_STEP_LADDERS_2026-08-17.md` (**THE PLAN; READ SEC 6.18 FIRST -- it supersedes the
step hunt. 6.16 holds the PRE-COMMITTED decision branches; 6.15 the five gated steps**) ->
HERE -> `COMPACTION_HANDOFF_2026-08-17.md` -> `PLAN_NEXT_24H.md` -> `LONG_TERM_PLAN.md`.

## POSITION
**ORGAN A (THE WRITE RULE) IS CLOSED. ALL FIVE STEPS GATED. THE ANSWER IS A LEARNING SIGNAL, AND THE
CORPUS IS EXONERATED (`0f8a3254a`).** The substitutability signal **IS PRESENT** in first-order counts
from our own corpus: a supervised diagonal reweighting of a PPMI+SVD space reaches AUC **0.9670**
fitted / **0.9606** held-out and -- after the leakage objection was TESTED rather than waved away
(37.6% of pair-member words appear in >1 pair) -- **0.8629 under GROUP-DISJOINT, word-clean CV**
(`56175e456`, `tools/verify_ppmi_svd_oracle_group_disjoint_cv.py`). **AND NOTHING UNSUPERVISED
REACHES IT:** our five steps 0.03-0.42; vanilla PPMI **0.0519**; TUNED counts **0.1144** (shift
selected on a WORD-DISJOINT held-out set, the Levy/Goldberg/Dagan steelman, `120cfefae`); second-order
cosine 0.0510; **from-scratch SGNS 0.4417 -- BELOW its own UNTRAINED random-init control at exactly
0.5000.** *Training a neural predictor on this corpus moves it TOWARD co-occurrence.* **So: the corpus
is NOT the blocker, first-order counts CONTAIN the signal, no unsupervised transform extracts it, and
the missing ingredient is WHAT TO SUPERVISE WITH.**

**THE TRAP THAT GOVERNS EVERYTHING NEXT, and it must be stated before any build: the instrument
defines its positive set by WORDNET SYNONYMY and its known-answer arm IS WordNet (0.9599). ANY
supervision derived from WordNet TRAINS ON THE TEST. The 0.8629 fitted oracle is a CEILING
DIAGNOSTIC, NEVER a candidate build.** Drill in flight: `admissible_supervision_sources_drill`.

**METHOD RESULT WORTH AS MUCH AS THE SCIENCE: FOUR arms produced apparent CI-separated wins that their
own controls destroyed** -- max-pool, prediction-error gating (**+0.2369, a 4.3x "improvement"**, killed
by a RATE-MATCHED random gate reading 0.3007 vs 0.3079), the `C2` denominator, and the learned basis.
**Without rate-matched and identity-matched twins this session would have reported four breakthroughs
and built on all of them.** *Any arm that changes HOW MUCH gets written now REQUIRES a rate-matched
random twin.*

**ELIMINATED, each with its own control:** the basis (learned = random), the denominator (row-norm is
a cosine no-op, PROVEN by an identical wrongpool control), not-collapsing (max-pool **-0.0210 BELOW**
the sum at 55x storage; its random-occurrence control sat AT CHANCE, proving the loss is
content-specific), the filter (**a same-size RANDOM draw reads 0.5041 vs the incumbent's 0.4173 --
our stopword selection is WORSE than random**), superposition (**DOES NOT EXIST** -- each word
reconstructs from its own counts to **1.76e-08** across all 617 words), prediction-error gating, and
corpus capacity.

**SUPERSEDED BELOW BUT KEPT FOR ITS REASONING:** **DRILL 1'S CENTRAL PREDICTION IS REFUTED. `CODE` IS
EXONERATED -- TWICE (`ac629b1e7`,
`exp_writerule_learned_basis_denominator_gate_v1`).** The drill argued our store is `H^T p_a`, a random
rotation of `Sigma_yx`, and that the missing operation is factorisation `Sigma_yx Sigma_xx^-1` living
in the `CODE` slot -- so a LEARNED basis should create substitutability where a random projection
cannot. **IT DOES NOT.** `C1_LEARNED_BASIS` +0.0073 [-0.0005,+0.0150] **NOT_SEPARATED**, and
`C1_CTRL_MATCHED_RANK_RANDOM` **MATCHES IT** (-0.0060). Composition moves for NO arm, while
`C1_CTRL_FREQUENCY_SHUFFLED` moves it **+0.0858 [+0.0486,+0.1229] ABOVE (worse)** -- which PROVES the
composition instrument can see change, so the flat readings are real nulls. **"Cortex expands where we
compress" also fails:** accuracy fell MONOTONICALLY across the k sweep, 0.0553 (k=64) -> 0.0393
(k=2048). And `C2`'s one CI-separated accuracy gain is **NOT a denominator effect** -- its winning
`pool='row'` divides each row by a scalar and **cosine is provably invariant to that** (the identical
`WRONGPOOL` control is the PROOF, not a control failure); the genuine denominators (`col`,
`both`=PPMI) scored BELOW A0. **AN ELEGANT DERIVATION IS A HYPOTHESIS. This one made a specific
prediction and its own controls killed it.**

**WHAT IS ESTABLISHED INSTEAD, on TWO independent instruments.** (1) `ACCUMULATE` is the measured
INTERFERENCE source (`b6cad69ca`): the CORRECT score is STATIONARY with depth (POP_128 +0.0013
[-0.0006,+0.0034]) while the competing FIELD's mean AND p95 rise CI-separated; mean pairwise anchor
cosine 0.0127 -> 0.272; **common-mode removal does NOT help (DO-NOT-REDO 27 stays closed)** and the
interference is DIFFUSE, not top-200 words. (2) **THE DISSOCIATION INSTRUMENT IS LICENSED**
(`0eb44eb1d`) -- **the first instrument this programme owns whose FOUR FLOORS SIT AT CHANCE and are
VERIFIED there** (0.5000 / 0.4901 / 0.4664 / 0.5431, every CI including 0.5; known-answer 0.9599 vs a
0.95 gate; random store 0.4862). On it, above 0.5 = substitutability, below = co-occurrence:
`RAW_COUNT_SINGLE_OCC` **0.4173** > `PARADIGMATIC_PROFILE_WRITE` **0.2165** > `INCUMBENT` **0.0710** >
`RAW_COUNT_FULL_ACCUM` **0.0510** > `PRESENCE_ABSENCE_BINARIZED` **0.0294**; the ranking is RESOLVABLE
(max_lo 0.3835 > min_hi 0.0470). **STOP-IF (iii) fired: the incumbent is CI-separated BELOW 0.5.**

**THE ANSWER IS THE LEARNING SIGNAL, AND IT IS MEASURED (`exp_corpus_capacity_ppmi_svd_ceiling_v1`,
plan sec 6.18).** Instrument licensed by EXACT reproduction -- all 8 regression checks at **delta
0.0000**; population loaded BYTE-IDENTICAL from the instrument's own checkpoint; matrix 5,491 x 21,576,
density 0.91%, 1.82M tokens, **coverage PERFECT 242/242 in both cells**.
- **PPMI+SVD FAILS ON OUR CORPUS AT EVERY RANK -- but QUALIFIED 2026-08-18 (`96caca8de`): we ran the
  VANILLA construction (no context-distribution smoothing, no shift, no subsampling). Levy & Goldberg
  proved SGNS implicitly factorises SHIFTED PMI, and a TUNED count method MATCHES SGNS. So the honest
  claim is "UNTUNED PPMI+SVD fails", and A TUNED-COUNT ARM IS NOW MANDATORY AND MUST BE REPORTED
  BEFORE ANY SUPERVISED ARM -- if it clears 0.5 unsupervised, the supervision conclusion below is
  WRONG and the missing thing was hyperparameters.** Numbers as run: k=50/100/300/500 -> **0.0519 / 0.0285 / 0.0230 / 0.0278**, all BELOW 0.5,
  and its BEST is WORSE than our incumbent 0.0710. No k dropped for cost. **We are NOT being beaten by
  truncated SVD.**
- **A SUPERVISED LOW-RANK REWEIGHTING OF THE SAME COUNTS READS 0.8629 UNDER THE STRICTEST TEST.**
  CORRECTED, and the agent caught it before reporting clean: the landed pair-level held-out figure is
  0.9606, but **37.6% of the 617 pair-member words appear in >1 pair**, so pair-level CV leaks word
  identity across folds. Group-disjoint GroupKFold (union-find -> 148 word-disjoint components,
  `tools/verify_ppmi_svd_oracle_group_disjoint_cv.py`) gives **0.8629**. **QUOTE 0.8629, NOT 0.9606**
  -- the finding SURVIVES, clearing 0.5 by a wide margin on pairs never jointly seen in fitting.
- **SAME counts, SAME 242 pairs, SAME scorer. SUPERVISION IS THE ONLY VARIABLE, AND IT MOVES AUC FROM
  0.03-0.07 TO 0.96.** So the missing thing is **NOT information, NOT representation capacity, NOT the
  write steps** -- **IT IS THE LEARNING SIGNAL.** Every arm we have ever built is unsupervised and
  chooses what to write with no error signal about which directions matter. **Routes to the project's
  own named flavour MISSING-LEARNING -> REUSE/EXPAND the learner, never a parallel build.**
- **NEVER QUOTE 0.9606 AS A CAPABILITY.** The oracle is FITTED ON THE EVALUATION CONSTRUCT. It proves
  the counts CONTAIN the signal; it does NOT show an unsupervised or brain-plausible learner finds it.
  The live question is what supervision a BRAIN has that we do not -- not a labelled synonym list, but
  prediction error, cross-modal correspondence, consequences of use. **DRILL, NOT BUILD.**

**ORGAN A IS NOW FULLY GATED -- ALL FIVE STEPS (`f311d0ac2`, `34d3fdbab`, plan sec 6.15).** FILTER:
**REAL BUT NEGATIVE-VALUE** -- a same-size RANDOM token draw reads **0.5041, CI-separated ABOVE** the
incumbent's 0.4173. CODE: exonerated x2. ACCUMULATE: interference source. NORMALISE: not in the live
path. SUPERPOSE: **DOES NOT EXIST** -- rebuilding each word from its OWN counts alone reproduces the
incumbent to **1.76e-08 across all 617 words**; proven by reconstruction, not argued.

**RETRACTED 2026-08-18: "the operative defect is COLLAPSING OCCURRENCES INTO ONE VECTOR."** Tested
directly and **FALSE**: `M1_MAXPOOL` (every occurrence kept, scored by best match) reads **0.0299,
-0.0210 [-0.0393,-0.0020] CI-separated BELOW** the sum, at **55x the storage**. Its control decides the
reading: `N1_MAXPOOL_RANDOM_OCC` sits **AT CHANCE (0.4545)**, NOT depressed -- so the depression needs
the word's OWN occurrence content and is not an artifact of the max operator. Not-collapsing is not
the fix.

**THE ORGAN-LEVEL FINDING, AND IT IS THE REAL RESULT: NOT ONE ARM THIS PROGRAMME HAS EVER MEASURED IS
CI-SEPARATED ABOVE 0.5 ON THE LICENSED INSTRUMENT.** Everything tops out AT chance and never above it
(`N2_SHUFFLED` 0.5296 NOT_SEP, `N1_RANDOM_FILTER` 0.5041 NOT_SEP, `S1_SINGLE_OCC` 0.4173), and
everything carrying MORE accumulated corpus content sits FURTHER BELOW (incumbent 0.0710, full accum
0.0510, max-pool 0.0299, binarised 0.0294). **Interventions that DESTROY information move us TOWARD
chance; interventions that ADD accumulated content move us AWAY from substitutability.** So the
ceiling is not a step we have yet to fix -- **first-order co-occurrence counts from this corpus appear
to carry a co-occurrence signal and NO substitutability signal for these five steps to expose.** The
best any configuration achieves is encoding NOTHING.
**CAVEAT, do not collapse these into one claim:** across `ACCUMULATE` the winner no-relation rate
FALLS 0.8400 -> 0.7971 (-0.043 CI-separated) -- **adjacency was present from sentence one; a bag of
neighbours IS an adjacency record.** Summing does not CREATE adjacency; it raises INTERFERENCE and
degrades retrieval. **REPORT WINNER SHARE, GOLD SHARE AND RATIO TOGETHER, ALWAYS** (the Director once
quoted 66.0->94.4 while dropping the gold's 23.9->60.3 and the ratio, which FELL 3.967->3.822).
**LIMIT: the dissociation instrument is n=242 matched pairs, ALL NOUNS** -- verb/adj/adv strata did not
survive its frequency caliper.
**RETRACTED (VET COMPLETE, off `exp_writerule_step_ladder_v1` `COMPOSITION_DELTA_TABLE`): "summing is
what converts our store from could-replace to appears-near."** FALSE, and backwards: across
`ACCUMULATE` the no-close-relation rate FALLS 0.8400 -> 0.7971, **-0.043 [-0.0800,-0.0086]
CI-SEPARATED**. Adjacency was there from sentence one -- a bag of neighbours IS an adjacency record.
The Director quoted the winner's co-occur share (66.0->94.4) and dropped the gold's (23.9->60.3) and
the RATIO, which FELL 3.967->3.822. **REPORT WINNER SHARE, GOLD SHARE AND RATIO TOGETHER, ALWAYS.**

ONE ORGAN AT A TIME, AND THE ORGAN IS THE WRITE RULE (owner ruling 2026-08-18, `PLAN_ORGAN_STEP_LADDERS`
sec 6.7). The cue side is finished and did not fix the reading; four cells changed the QUESTION we hand
the store and every one improved FINDING THE DRAWER while none improved READING WHAT IS IN IT
(binarising takes addressing 0.0711 -> 0.1094 while hit@1 moves 0.0223 -> 0.0249, +0.0026
[-0.0026,+0.0078] NOT_SEPARATED -- ADDRESSING AND READ-OUT ARE SEPARATELY CAPPED).
**THE DECISIVE WRITE-RULE MEASUREMENT, and it is why this organ is the one:** varying ONLY the target's
own stored row, `SUM_ALL` reads **0.0100**, ONE occurrence picked at RANDOM reads **0.0367**, and
`BEST_SINGLE_ORACLE` reads **0.3033** against the **0.1390** floor we have never cleared. *Summing is
worse than not summing, and individual sentences already carry enough to clear the floor.* The oracle
is a CEILING DIAGNOSTIC, never a capability. **DEPTH IS RETRACTED (sec 6.6): "+0.0503 still climbing"
was an ORACLE-CUE number; on the REAL partial cue POP_72 32->72 is BELOW and POP_128 is NOT_SEPARATED,
with winner composition FLAT at every depth.** Eleven cells across six organs on 08-17 returned ~+0.01
each; the two LADDERS redirected the programme. Method is not in question -- organ selection was.

## TOP ITEM -- FIND AN ADMISSIBLE SUPERVISION SIGNAL THAT IS NOT THE EVALUATION GOLD
Organ A is closed and its answer is that we need a LEARNING SIGNAL. **The whole question is now WHICH
ONE, and the binding constraint is CIRCULARITY, not performance.**
**VERIFIED OFF DISK 2026-08-18, not asserted** (`exp_dissociation_score_instrument_v1.py`):
`SET_P` is built by `build_wordnet_synonym_candidates()` (line 304) from `wn.synsets()` (line 312);
the known-answer arm is WordNet path similarity (0.9599); and `SET_S` **explicitly EXCLUDES any
WordNet pair even at high co-occurrence** (evidence key
`set_S_excludes_wordnet_pair_even_at_high_cooccurrence`, line 674). **So WordNet does not merely
influence the labels -- it DEFINES both sides of them.** Therefore **any signal derived from WordNet --
synonyms, hypernyms, glosses, or anything computed from them -- trains on the test and is UNUSABLE AS
SUPERVISION however well it scores.** Second constraint, the
owner's invariant: **NO LLM in the operational path**, and a pretrained table is disqualified as a
MEANING SOURCE (ceiling reference only) -- **but a STATIC OFFLINE-BUILT ASSET IS ADMISSIBLE** (owner
Q3: *"we can build that foundation however we want, as long as it is a strong foundation, and the
operation is not llm"*). Do not hold us to a stricter standard than the brain meets.
**IN FLIGHT:** `admissible_supervision_sources_drill` -- biology first (what supervises cortical
semantics, and what the prediction-error NULL does and does NOT rule out: it tested error against the
word's OWN accumulator, which is not error against ANOTHER MODALITY or a DOWNSTREAM CONSEQUENCE);
then an **on-disk enumeration by `os.walk`, never registry-first** (a 1.21M-edge CSKG read by nobody
live -- **check whether it CONTAINS WordNet before trusting it**; OpenStax 117,642 sentences;
Brysbaert concreteness; Warriner VAD; Binder; UD parses); then a ranking on brain fidelity /
independence-from-gold / coverage on the 617 matched-pair words / no-LLM survival; then ONE build
with a mandatory rate-matched control.

## SUPERSEDED TOP ITEM -- THE WRITE RULE WAS THE FIRST THING TO MOVE READ-OUT (LESSONS: WRITE RULE)
`exp_readout_writerule_paradigmatic_v1` (full, `a8fdc968f` / `24ca42661`) rebuilt the STORE so a
word's code sums its neighbours' own context PROFILES instead of their arbitrary identity tags, and
left the comparator untouched. `W1_PARADIGMATIC` **0.0298** vs `W0_SYNTAGMATIC` **0.0223**: **+0.0075
[+0.0023,+0.0128]**, half-width 0.00525, analytic null half-width 0.00458, **ABOVE** (~34% relative).
A frequency-matched profile control reads 0.0225 and does NOT beat W0 (+0.0002 NOT_SEPARATED); a
random-profile null reads 0.0188 and does not either (-0.0035 NOT_SEPARATED -- lower, not separated);
three hybrid alphas all land +0.0065..+0.0070 ABOVE; K1 addressing 1.0000 on all seven arms;
orthographic leakage flat at W0's own value. **NO STOP-IF FIRED CLEANLY** and the cell wrote the
honest fourth reading itself: *the write rule was PART of the defect but is not sufficient* -- W1 is
still **-0.0575 [-0.0673,-0.0478] BELOW** its own binding floor (orthographic 0.08731), 2.9x short.
**THE CONTRAST IS THE FINDING: the read-out scoreboard's ~39 prior arms ALL changed the COMPARATOR
and none beat the incumbent CI-separated; this one changed the WRITE RULE and did.** `wire_status` is
`VET_PENDING` -- WIRE-or-SHELVE not decided.

## CUE SIDE -- CLOSED IN FOUR CELLS (LESSONS: CUE SIDE CLOSED; DO-NOT-REDO 44, 45, 46)
(1) PLAN ITEM 3 landed a CLEAN NULL (`2e5a467ae`): `A0_FLAT` reproduces item 1's 0.0849 target
exactly (regression gate PASS), `T1` key-sparsified 0.0704 = **-0.0145 [-0.0203,-0.0088] BELOW**,
`T2` cue-sparsified 0.0886 is the grid's raw MAXIMUM yet **+0.0037 [-0.0013,+0.0088] NOT_SEPARATED**,
T2 vs T1 +0.0182 ABOVE, oracle 1.0000 and random 0.0000 both passing. **Stop-if (i) fired. The cell's
own verdict: "Neither, cleanly" -- no arm beat the flat store and the sparsified arms LOST accuracy
rather than matching it more cheaply.** `C1` vs `T1` is bit-identical 0.0 [0,0] BUT CARRIES A
CONSTRUCTION CAVEAT: K=32 exceeds the cue's own median nnz of 12.0, so that truncation is a no-op for
most items and the tie is partly an artifact. (2) COMPRESSION DIAGNOSED (`201776cc9`): what matters
is PRESENCE, not counts -- the losing property is MAGNITUDE, not sparsity and not non-negativity.
`B1_BINARIZED_RAW` (presence only, uncompressed) +0.0383 [+0.0293,+0.0476]
above the incumbent and +0.0248 [+0.0160,+0.0338] above raw counts; S1 -0.0100 BELOW, N1 -0.0003
NOT_SEPARATED. Loss is CONCENTRATED: the 93 lost items have shorter cues (10.80 vs 12.48) and much
sparser store profiles (106.4 vs 210.8), both CI-separated. (3) IT DOES NOT TRANSFER (`1e085d761`) --
see POSITION; R2 (binarised THEN projected) gives back two thirds of the addressing gain, so **the
two defects are not independent**. (4) THE BASIN THEORY IS REFUTED -- see CLEANUP.

## PHASE DIAGRAM -- THERE ISN'T ONE (LESSONS: PHASE DIAGRAM)
`substrate_phase_diagram_recovered_from_experimental_history_2026-08-17.md` (`32cc8ce71`), enumerated
from the filesystem: 7,804 `metrics.json` (re-walked 7,807, delta = this session's own files, nothing
missing); ~59 vary dimensionality, ~21 sparsity, 2 expansion; **23 of 42 parameter-by-operation
squares NEVER MEASURED**, 13 usable, six diagrams on six scorers that may NOT be merged. The "55-65%
coverage" recollection traces to `director_TRUE_PHASE_DIAGRAM_COVERAGE_2026-06-30.md`, whose own line
items say ~10% and <5%. Q13's sparsity sweep has NO cell under `data/` -- it is in gitignored
`scratch/sparsify_right_object/`; promote before the next clear. **Its d-sweep row is corrected by
C36.**

## BRIDGING -- TWO MEASURED NULLS (LESSONS: DO-NOT-REDO 38, 43)
Phase 2 FULL: B1 rho 0.0270 n=394 vs floors 0.0412/0.0317/0.0905, NOT_SEPARATED, perm p 0.30, both
known-answer arms ABOVE (K1 0.3301, K2_ORACLE 0.2893); bridged codes KEEP IDENTITY (96.12% distinct)
and LOSE MEANING (retention 0.0819); the curated CSKG arm fails too. SELECTIONAL-CONSTRAINT
BRIDGING, the owner's own mechanism, is the SECOND and worse null: -0.1049 [-0.2041,-0.0057] BELOW
the incumbent, -0.0015 NOT_SEPARATED from a random target, instrument alive (K1 0.3311). KILL
STATUS: withdrawn for thematic, re-worded for selectional, per HANDOFF 8b(B) -- whose numbers remain
NOT re-verified by any pass.

## STORAGE -- THE WRITE/READ ASYMMETRY IS REAL AND DID NOT SURVIVE AS A WIN (LESSONS: WRITE/READ ASYMMETRY)
`exp_sparse_address_dense_value_v1` (n=3994, own floors): best partial-cue addressing anywhere is
0.0719 at a DENSE address; a 1%-occupancy address (82 of 8192 units) read with a DENSE cue matches
it at 0.0699, CIs overlapping; read SYMMETRICALLY it is 0.0483, 1.45x worse; the dense read wins 18
of 24 matched pairs, max 6.27x. **RE-TESTED 08-17 on the UNCOMPRESSED base, where it is a DIRECTION
AND NOT A WIN: T2 (cue sparsified) beats T1 (key sparsified) +0.0182 CI-separated, but T2 does not
beat the flat store (+0.0037 NOT_SEPARATED).** C36: the d-sweep line "0.0711 -> 0.0716 at 8192" mixes
read regimes; matched at `a_read=1.0` it is 0.0711 / 0.0714 / **0.0709** -- 32x the memory buys less
than nothing, so the conclusion strengthens.

## CLEANUP / SURPRISE / TARGET SPACE (LESSONS: CLEANUP MEMORY, SURPRISE, TARGET SPACE)
**AND THE BASIN EXPLANATION FOR THE CLEANUP NULLS IS REFUTED (`exp_cleanup_basin_conditional_v1`,
landed 08-16 22:41, UNREAD BY ANYONE FOR ~14 HOURS).** Six tau strata summing to 3994, known-answer
arm 1.0000 in every one: lift is CI-separated ABOVE **only in the LOWEST-tau stratum** (+0.0036
[+0.0009,+0.0072]) and NOT_SEPARATED in every higher one **including the highest** (+0.0154
[-0.0039,+0.0347]) -- the OPPOSITE of what basin theory predicts and of what the cell pre-registered
as confirming. It licensed skipping an elaborate settle mechanism, and the one cheap settle arm run
anyway is null (-0.0010 [-0.0025,+0.0003]). **AN UNREAD RUN IS A RUN THAT DID NOT HAPPEN -- second
instance in two days.**
CLEANUP MEMORY IS REAL, NOT INERT (fixed points 1.0000, idempotent, capacity on VSA's own d/log d
scale): first measured lift, +0.0033 and +0.0078 CI-separated in 2 of 3 pools, every arm still
-0.1135 BELOW the binding constant floor -- which makes the FIVE BANKED CLEANUP NULLS STRONGER, the
load-bearing half was NOT missing. SURPRISE-WEIGHTING: clean null, named cause -- signal DEGENERATE
(median 0.875 where 1.0 is orthogonal), selection beats a token-matched random subset in 4 of 18
comparisons, residual rule a near-no-op (cos 0.9771 to uniform) = the PRE-REGISTERED bootstrapping
problem. TARGET SPACE: affect +0.1013 is a CEILING DIAGNOSTIC, no floors, no null, clears nothing;
its verb half is now MEASURED, not suspended (C33).

## TOOLING STATE (LESSONS: VERDICT BAR, SKIPPED FULLS, C31, C32)
Corrected base rate: 7,789 enumerated, MEETS_BAR **1** (`exp_cue_to_store_translation_v1`), FAILS
7,770, NO_EVIDENCE 18; 238 flagged cells ARE cited by an index -- OPEN OPERATOR DECISION, NOT TAKEN.
The one pass is rejected on four grounds (pool admits a fitted constant 0.7354 vs chance 0.0625;
exact-key is not the operating point; the cell declines a verdict; margin overstated 4.20x).
`verdict_bar_check.py` HAS FALSE-PASSED FOUR TIMES -- run it, NEVER rely on its verdict, state
arm-by-arm margins; it also returns NO_EVIDENCE on any cell whose arms are nested per-stratum
(ITEM 2's). Only 12 of 7,789 cells ever recorded a constant floor, so every historical bar decision
used a THREE-floor max. `matched_candidate_sets` WAS VOID and is rebuilt; `eligB` still suspect.
FOUNDATION v4 ~49% (`d62acfe58`); TRIAGE -> `RECOVERY_PROGRAM.md`.

C32 "0 of 7,769 meet the bar" -> 1 of 7,789, and that survivor is itself rejected; **C33 "our
instrument cannot resolve verbs even when handed the answer" -- SUSPENDED at n=86, now MEASURED at
n=222: rho 0.2607 [0.1282,0.3841], strongest floor (scramble p95) 0.1152 against a 0.1107 null-width
orientation, margin +0.1452 [-0.0496,+0.3379] NOT_SEPARATED, permutation p 0.001. The null genuinely
tightened, so this is a real negative and not the n=86 artifact. A verb-channel build is licensed
CITING THIS AND NEVER THE RETIRED n=86 NUMBER;** C34 "the constant floor is the binding one" FALSE
in general -- it is -0.1959 on the bridging stratum and -0.2253 on the selectional one, the WEAKEST
member of the four; **C35 "the binding-operator choice is EMPIRICALLY NULL across two cells and six
operators" (HANDOFF 8b(D)) is PART-WRONG THREE WAYS -- a 3-BIN instrument is not a null (and FHRR
reads 0.8000 vs Hadamard 0.2889 inside the very bin that produced "invariant"); the 500/500/500 half
names the wrong cell and is SUPERSEDED, not absent; and two of the six operators COLLAPSE (0.0720
and 0.0000 against ~0.81). The operator has never been varied on any job this programme runs on.**
**C36 "d 256->8192 moves partial-cue addressing 0.0711->0.0716" MIXES READ REGIMES -- 0.0716 is the
`a_read=0.2` cell at D=8192; matched at `a_read=1.0` the sweep is 0.0711/0.0714/0.0709, so the
conclusion (dimensionality does nothing for addressing) STRENGTHENS. The correction already filed
against it is ALSO wrong: 0.0716 does NOT trace to a D=2048 draw, it is a genuine D=8192 reading
(`BEST_ASYMMETRIC_REGIME_SWITCH_CONFIG`). Both notes fixed in place. Second correction-of-a-
correction in one day.**

## STANDING DISCIPLINES -- NEVER-TRIM -- LESSONS
1 NO HAND-SCORED MEANINGFUL-DELTA GATE WHILE THE GENERATOR SITS AT 1-3% -- cost TWO experiments, the
2nd claiming to have FIXED the 1st; gate on KNOWN-ANSWER RECALL. 2 SERIALIZE MEASUREMENT vs CODE
CHANGE (2x). 3 A CHECKER SHARING A FLAW WITH WHAT IT CHECKS HIDES IT (4x in one night; C31 = 5th).
4 ESTABLISH THE FINAL LANDED VERSION BEFORE EVALUATING A SUBSYSTEM (6x); AN ABSENCE CLAIM REQUIRES
AN ENUMERATION, NOT A SEARCH -- state HOW. 5 BEFORE GATING ON A BENCHMARK, CHECK THE BRAIN PERFORMS
THE OPERATION IT SCORES. 6 RUN A POSITIVE / KNOWN-ANSWER ARM (2x): a FLOOR says whether the EFFECT
is real, a KNOWN-ANSWER arm whether the INSTRUMENT is -- run both. 7 NO DEMOTION WITHOUT A FRESH
ON-DISK RE-CHECK -- ~11 wrongly demoted, 17 corrections-of-a-correction in 48h; keep
EXISTS/IS-REACHED/IS-GOOD separate. **C35 is the 18th: a correction said a claim "does not
reproduce" when the cell it reproduces in was never opened.** 8 A GATE IS A CI-SEPARATED MARGIN
ABOVE max(ORTHOGRAPHIC, FREQUENCY, SCRAMBLE, CONSTANT) on the IDENTICAL scorer/n/pool/gold -- never
a bare number, baseline STANDALONE, every floor recomputed on the item's OWN population.
9 DETECTORS FIRE ON HONESTY (49/49 flagged were false positives). 10 SILENT JOINS FABRICATE GREEN
AND RED -- ASSERT+COUNT joined rows. 11 A NUMBER MAY NOT BE CARRIED BETWEEN SCORERS OR POPULATIONS
-- cost 3x in one night (C28/C29/C30); name the scorer, n, pool and gold for BOTH sides or you have
no comparison. 12 A CLAIM MEASURED AT THE EXACT-KEY OPERATING POINT DOES NOT TRANSFER TO THE
PARTIAL-CUE REGIME, WHICH IS THE REAL ONE -- top-50 0.5566 exact vs 0.3758 partial; state the cue
regime beside every retrieval number. 13 REPORT TIE CONVENTIONS BOTH WAYS, NEVER SILENTLY PICK THE
FLATTERING ONE -- +0.0105 NOT_SEP flips to +0.0641 ABOVE on tie mass alone. 14 REPORT THE CI
HALF-WIDTH AND THE NULL p95 AT THAT n BESIDE EVERY MARGIN -- A WIDTH IS NOT AN EFFECT. Cost 3x in
one night (C32/C33/C34), each an UNDERPOWERED NULL read as a CAPABILITY STATEMENT; at n=86 the
"floor" WAS the null distribution's own spread. **15 A GRID'S RESOLUTION IS PART OF ITS VERDICT: an
equality reported on a 3-value grid is a BIN, not a measurement (C35). State the swept values and
the number of queries per point beside every "no difference".**

## WHAT IS RUNNING / BLOCKED
- **WRITE-RULE ORGAN, GATE STATE (2026-08-18).** `CODE` **EXONERATED TWICE** (`ac629b1e7` -- a learned
  basis is MATCHED by a same-rank RANDOM basis; nothing moves composition; drill 1's prediction is
  REFUTED). `ACCUMULATE` **GATED = the INTERFERENCE source** (`b6cad69ca`). **The DISSOCIATION
  INSTRUMENT IS LICENSED** (`0eb44eb1d`) -- four floors AT CHANCE and verified there, the first such
  instrument this programme owns; incumbent AUC **0.0710**, single-occurrence **0.4173**, above 0.5
  would mean substitutability. `FILTER` and `SUPERPOSE` are the two steps still UNGATED.
- **ONE AGENT LIVE:** `noncollapse-maxpool` -- the organ's decisive build. Scores MAX-over-occurrences
  vs the incumbent SUM on the licensed dissociation instrument, with `N1_MAXPOOL_RANDOM_OCC` as the
  control that decides whether any gain is the mechanism or merely the max operator. Do NOT edit
  `experiments/` or `hdlab/` while it runs. **It replaces `exp_organ_f_noncollapsing_accumulation_v1`,
  which was KILLED at ~9 h projected runtime (spherical k-means per anchor); that cell is on disk,
  self-tested, and is NOT the current attempt.**
- **THE OVERNIGHT LOOP IS FIXED AND VERIFIED (2026-08-18), after running exactly ONE turn for days.**
  Three defects, all real: the `Stop` hook was registered ONLY in `hd-instrument/.claude/settings.json`
  which is NOT the session's project root, so it never executed (canary silent since 08-13) -- now
  registered in `D:/AI/.claude/settings.json` beside the SessionStart hook that demonstrably fires;
  `_plan_path()` resolved only `PLAN_NEXT_12H.md`/`PLAN.md`, NEITHER OF WHICH EXISTS, so every
  continuation pointed at a missing file; and **GUARD 1 returned on `stop_hook_active`
  unconditionally, so the chain could continue ONCE and the cap of 200 was unreachable by
  construction.** GUARD 1 now continues while ARMED, bounded by the cap AND a 20 s wall-clock floor;
  DISARMED behaviour is unchanged. GUARD 1D narrowed to `permission-rule` + `user-rejected` only
  (owner ruling) -- `cancelled` teardowns are logged, never halt. Self-test OVERALL PASS.
- `.claude/scan-out/` REFUSES FILE CREATION (4x); `notes/ tools/ experiments/ verification/` accept.
  `experiments/exp_propose_reject_retrieval_v1.py` IS A BLOCKED PATH -- OWNER'S CALL, never retry a
  variant.
- NO BACKUP, gitignored: `data/foundation/reading_grounding_v1` + `v2_qualityfix` (22+23MB).
  Also gitignored and citation-bearing: `scratch/sparsify_right_object/` (the Q13 sparsity numbers).
- Three `data/cornerstone_results/*/metrics.json` are deleted in the working tree but PRESENT in
  git (`39cc197ff`) -- recoverable, not lost; nobody has decided whether the deletion was intended.
- USER AUTH: `d=256->1024` (rewrites every anchor store; the phase-diagram pass says it is justified
  for the comparison job and NOT for addressing), merge to `origin/main`, any push. Autoloop ARMED
  at 200.
- `hd_director_kb_continuous_ingest` LIVELOCKED (10.65 GB, self-killed at 45 min) while the
  scheduler reports it healthy -- `director_kb_query.py` and `substrate_query.sh` are STALE and
  `substrate_query.sh` currently ERRORS on a locked cache file rather than returning no hits.
- **DATA HAZARD FOUND AND FIXED 2026-08-17 -- THIS ENTRY'S EARLIER WORDING IS SUPERSEDED.** It read
  "`notes/LONG_TERM_PLAN.md` HAS NEVER BEEN COMMITTED", which was true when written. **It is now
  TRACKED, committed unchanged at `0c8d202d7`** (`git log -- notes/LONG_TERM_PLAN.md` returns that
  one commit; the working tree is clean against it at 32,823 B). The hazard is closed; the staleness
  below is not.
- `LONG_TERM_PLAN.md` also stale: sec 2 rows 3/4/6 superseded by STORAGE + C30; sec 4's dual-hub
  `[PINNED]` (line 185) should drop to CONTESTED; its Phase 2 kill banner (line 343) is recorded as
  FIRED without the 8b(B) withdrawal-for-thematic. Director's call, NOT done here (PLAN sec 9).
- OVER CAP AND DELIBERATELY SO, AND THE GAP GREW AGAIN: **19,450 B against the 8,704 cap** (11,571 B
  on 08-16, 15,149 B after the first 08-17 docs pass, this figure after the third). The new growth is
  never-trim class -- five landed results, DO-NOT-REDO 44/45/46 each with a revival criterion, C36 --
  offset only partly by tier trims to PHASE DIAGRAM, BRIDGING and STORAGE. **`STATUS_SPEC.md` sec 7's
  own measurement is now stale by ~7.9 KB and BOTH of its options (raise to 12,288 B; move the stub
  index into an uncapped `STATUS_CLOSED.md`, which was sized to land this file at ~8,580 B) are now
  undersized -- re-measure before enacting either.** Still PROPOSED, NOT ENACTED: DIRECTOR'S CALL.
  Never close the gap by evicting a never-trim entry.
