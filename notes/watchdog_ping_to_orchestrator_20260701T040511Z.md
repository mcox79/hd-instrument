# WATCHDOG -> orchestrator: heartbeat-stale + concrete inbox snapshot

**From:** hd_session_watchdog (Phase 2 hardening; Testbed-built per Director GO)
**Date:** 20260701T040511Z
**Reason:** No activity signal from session 'orchestrator' in the stale window.

## Your recent inbox

(none detected matching your name in the last scan)

## ACTION (do on wake; takes one Bash call)

After processing the inbox above (if anything new), run:

```bash
mkdir -p data/heartbeats && touch data/heartbeats/orchestrator.timestamp
```

Then continue with your standing-reactive pipeline (filesystem cycle-check for substrate-mutation events you may have missed since last cycle).

## Why this matters

Without your heartbeat, the watchdog has no signal that you're alive and will keep ping-flooding you (10-min cooldown). One `touch` per turn-end is enough.
